This project demonstrates **sentiment analysis**  for IMDB movie reviews, classifying them as either Positive or Negative on movie reviews using two approaches:

1. **Classical Machine Learning (ML)** — Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features
2. **Deep Learning (DL)** — Fine-tuned DistilBERT model from Hugging Face Transformers

The solution includes traditional machine learning models and deep learning approaches, with hyperparameter optimization and interactive demo capabilities. We trained the DistilBERT model for very less epoch, only 5 epochs due to resources limitations.
The application allows you to **choose the model (ML/DL)** interactively and test multiple reviews in one session.

## 🚀 Usage
Download the full project and Run the main script:

    
    streamlit_app.py

    
first install requirements.txt

      pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run the app by

      streamlit run streamlit_app.py

Finally it is ready to use and check review classification.

### Demo script: where a user inputs a sentence, and the model predicts sentiment.

   After installing requirements.txr, then Run the Demo Script
   
      python DemoScript.py

## 📜 Scripts

DemoScript.py. In this file, an Interactive sentiment analysis using ML or DL script is given.

### Key features:

- Preloads model and vectorizer/tokenizer

- Interactive loop for multiple reviews

- Model can be changed after each review

- Shows both label and confidence score (for DL model)

### The Jupyter Notebook main code file contain script as well to predict review will:

- Ask you to choose ML or DL at the start

- Let you enter movie reviews repeatedly

- Show predictions until you type quit

*Example Interaction*

Choose model (ml/dl): ml
Enter 'quit' to stop reviewing.

Enter movie review: I absolutely loved this film!
Prediction (Logistic Regression): Positive

Choose model (ml/dl): dl
Enter movie review: This was terrible and boring.
Prediction (DistilBERT): NEGATIVE (score: 0.9987)

Enter movie review: quit
Exiting...
