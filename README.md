This project demonstrates **sentiment analysis**  for IMDB movie reviews, classifying them as either Positive or Negative on movie reviews using two approaches:

1. **Classical Machine Learning (ML)** — Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features
2. **Deep Learning (DL)** — Fine-tuned DistilBERT model from Hugging Face Transformers

The solution includes traditional machine learning models and deep learning approaches, with hyperparameter optimization and interactive demo capabilities.
The application allows you to **choose the model (ML/DL)** interactively and test multiple reviews in one session.

🎯 Task Requirements Completed
✅ Step 1: Data Preparation

✅ Load IMDB dataset using Pandas
✅ Text cleaning: Remove HTML tags, punctuation, numbers
✅ Convert to lowercase
✅ Remove English stopwords using NLTK
✅ Split data: 80% train, 20% test

✅ Step 2: Model Training

Key Findings
Best Traditional ML Model: Logistic Regression (86.4% accuracy)

Best Overall Model: Fine-tuned DistilBERT (91.2% accuracy)

Optimal TF-IDF Configuration:

N-grams: (1, 2)

Max features: 20,000

Min document frequency: 2


🚀 Usage
Run the main script:

python sentiment_app.py

The script will:

-Ask you to choose ML or DL at the start

-Let you enter movie reviews repeatedly

-Show predictions until you type quit

*Example Interaction*

Choose model (ml/dl): ml
Enter 'quit' to stop reviewing.

Enter movie review: I absolutely loved this film!
Prediction (Logistic Regression): Positive

Choose model (ml/dl): dl
Enter movie review: This was terrible and boring.
Prediction (DistilBERT): NEGATIVE (score: 0.9987)

Enter movie review: quit
Exiting...

📜 Scripts
1. sentiment_app.py
Interactive sentiment analysis using ML or DL.

Key features:

Preloads model and vectorizer/tokenizer

Interactive loop for multiple reviews

Model can be changed after each review

Shows both label and confidence score (for DL model)

2. debug_distilbert.py
Debugging script to test DistilBERT behavior.

Usage:

bash


python debug_distilbert.py

What it does:

-Prints model label mapping (id2label)

-Tests predictions on various example reviews

-Compares your model with Hugging Face's default sentiment model

⚠️ Troubleshooting
1. DistilBERT always predicts "NEGATIVE"
Possible causes:

-Imbalanced training data (majority negative samples)

-Label mapping issue in model config

-Tokenization mismatch between training and inference

Solution:

-Check debug_distilbert.py output to verify label mapping

-If labels are swapped, fix id2label in config.json

-Re-train with class weights or balanced dataset

🧠 Training Notes
-ML model trained with Logistic Regression on TF-IDF features from movie reviews dataset
-DL model is a fine-tuned distilbert-base-uncased on the same dataset for binary classification (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE)
